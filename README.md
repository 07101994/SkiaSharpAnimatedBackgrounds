# SkiaSharp Animated Backgrounds

A .NET implementation of https://github.com/AndreBaltazar8/flutter_animated_background

I am not biased ðŸ˜œ but ovbiously Xamarin and .NET requires much less code - and none of that weird UI strings mid-code.

Not sure where this is going, but seems to work just fine.
